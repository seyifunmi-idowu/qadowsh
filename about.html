                                <p>Qadowsh is a soul singer who blends contemporary and classical music to tell
                                    her audience the beautiful story of God, life and nature.
                                    <br>Born in Lagos, Qadowsh spent her younger years experiencing the northern and western
                                    culture because of her travelling father whose job took him from city to city. She
                                    eventually moved from Gombe to Lagos where she finished her secondary school education.
                                </p>
                                <p>Her musical journey started for her in secondary school, where she had to lead the
                                    school's choir which she did beautifully and even got an award recognising her as ‘’Most
                                    Gifted Singer’’ in the school. This quest further led her to join a singing group called
                                    Lifestyl in Somolu. With Lifestyl, she explored music and singing more which gave her
                                    the sure footing she needed professionally.
                                    <br>Her love and passion for music even became much stronger that she gradually ditched
                                    her initial desire to study Occupational Therapy in the university which would have
                                    pleased her father.
                                    <br>She enrolled in a number of singing contests to show her singing prowess and made
                                    friends who are now noted industry people along the way.</p>

                                        She
                                        successfully got an admission to study Music in University of Lagos and graduated in
                                        2014.
                                        <br>Following that, Qadowsh won an MTN Scholarship to bag a Diploma in Music in

                                        which she successfully did in 2017 and got an award also as Best Vocalist of her
                                        class.
                                        <br>As she was studying in both institutions, Qadowsh sat for the Associated Board
                                        of
                                        Royal School of Music (ABRSM) Grades seven and eight (Music Theory and practical)

                                        <br>Qadowsh has also tested her hands on a couple of musical instruments like the
